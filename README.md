# Hints

This is a reasonably long project, with quite a lot of coding. I don't want you to get too caught up in the coding details (though that is definitely part of the skill I want you to learn!).
If you get stuck on the code, please collaborate with each other, and ask me questions. I'd rather you spend time on doing and understanding the physics.
Below are a few hints that you may find helpful.
Also in this repository is a few simple example code-snippets. You are free to use these snippets in your own code; of course, you'll have to adept them for the current problem. If you do use these, make sure you can explain how they work and what they're doing.

## Question 2

* The required equation is difficult to solve numerically. There are a few tricks
* With the default parameters, the older python function: `scipy.integrate.odeint` seems to work better than the newer one (`scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`)
* Your life will be made much easier if you define functions for everything you require: a function for Y_eq, a function for dY/dx, a function to convert Y to Omega etc.
* To increase numerical precision available, you should re-scale Y(x) by a constant _before_ solveing the ODE - then rescale back to get the result. For example:

$$
\begin{align}
G(x) &= \mu Y(x)\\
\frac{dG(x)}{dx} &=  \frac{m}{x^2} \langle\sigma v\rangle (\mu^2Y_{eq}^2(x) - G^2(x))
\end{align}
$$

where we chose

$$
\mu = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{45}}M_{\rm Pl}\sqrt{g_*}.
$$

The equation to solve for Y might then look something like:

```python
def solve_dYdx(x_list, spin_j, mass, sv_x):
    x0 = x_list[0]
    y0 = Yeq(spin_j, x0)
    g0 = mu * y0
    return scipy.integrate.odeint(dGdx, g0, x_list, args=(spin_j, mass, sv_x), tfirst=True) / mu
```

Setting the initial x too small will make the equation very difficult to solve (you should think about why).
You can play around with different starting points to see which works best.
A typical starting point may be x~10. You will probably need to integrate out to at least x ~ few 100.

## Question 3

You will find everything much easier if you code everything using natural units, and only convert back to "real" units for input/output. The only really tricky one is converting $\langle\sigma v\rangle$ from ${\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$ to ${\rm GeV}^{-2}$ -- this was done in the lecture notes (be careful to go the right way!)

To find the region in the $m_\chi$ vs. $\langle\sigma v\rangle$ plane where $\Omega\,h^2$ matches the Planck CMB analysis, you can use a root-finding method. Several are provided in python's scipy library

* [scipy.optimize.brentq](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.brentq.html)
* [scipy.optimize.fsolve.html](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.fsolve.html)

Both should work, though fsolve seems to be easier to use. e.g.,

```python
scipy.optimize.fsolve(func, a)
```

will return x such that f(x)=0, where $a$ is an initial guess at the root.

In our case, we want function to be

$$
\Omega_{\rm model}(m_\chi, \langle\sigma v\rangle) - \Omega_{\rm observed}
$$

For example, we would have a function that calculates the current abundance something like:

```python
def current_abundance(x_list, spin_j, mass, sv_x):
    """Find current abundance: Solve dYdx, get Y at large x, convert to Oh^2"""
    Y = solve_dYdx(x_list, spin_j, mass, sv_x)
    Y_current = Y[-1]
    return convert_to_Oh2(Y_current[0], mass)
```

We might, for example, want to loop through several masses, and optimise this function for $\langle\sigma v\rangle$ for each mass. Don't forget the take account of the 3-sigma Planck error bars!

**Note** You must optimise the function for a _parameter_ (or variable), rather than a function. So, if you have a function that calculates the cross-section as a function of $x$, you need to optimise over the parameter of that function, i.e., the average value of $\langle\sigma v\rangle$.
There are a number of ways to do this. The most "professional" way is to use lists of parameters (i.e., your $\langle\sigma v\rangle$ should be a function of $x$ _and_ the other parameters). In our case, the easiest way is to just define a new function inside the loop.
You might have something like:

```python
    for mass in mass_list:

        def func_to_optimise(sigmav0):
            sigmav_const = lambda x: sigmav0
            return current_abundance(x_list, spin, mass, sigmav_const) - Oh2_Planck

        sigmav_fitted = scipy.optimize.fsolve(func, sigmav0_guess)[0]
```

Here, `sigmav0` is a parameter (i.e., a float) corresponding to the constant cross-section, and `sigmav_fitted` is the

If you're not use to lambdas, they're just a simple way of defining inline functions. The `sigmav_const = lambda x: sigmav0` is equivilant to:

```python
    def sigmav_const(x):
     return sigmav0
```

Final hint: you might find it better to work in the log space, since these functions vary over so many orders of magnitude.
This makes it much easier for the root solver to solve the equation.
You need to make only very minor changes to do this, for example

```python
    for mass in mass_list:

        def func_to_optimise(log_sigmav0):
            sigmav_const = lambda x: 10**log_sigmav0
            return current_abundance(x_list, spin, mass, sigmav_const) - Oh2_Planck

        log_sigmav_fitted = scipy.optimize.fsolve(func, np.log10(sigmav0_guess))[0]
        sigmav_fitted = 10**log_sigmav_fitted
```

The function we now optimise, func_to_optimise, is a function of the _log_ of the cross-section.

## Question 4

To find the thermally-averaged cross-section, $\langle\sigma v\rangle_{\rm eff}$, you will have to integrate (average) over $s$.

$$
\langle\sigma v\rangle_{\rm eff} = \int_{4m^2}^\infty .....  v(s){\rm d}s
$$

For numerical reasons, it is often easier to do a change of variables, t=1/s, and instead integrate over t. Note that t=0 is likely not valid - it instead suffices to take this as a very small number [e.g., $1/(20\,m^2$)]

$$
\langle\sigma v\rangle_{\rm eff} = \int_{0}^{1/(4m^2)} .....  v(t)\frac{1}{t^2}{\rm d}t
$$

Python's scipy library provides several functions for performing integrals. One that is often a good fit is `scipy.integrate.quad` [docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.quad](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.quad.html)

Providing you write code for the integrand `integrand_sveff_t(t)`, code for this may look something like:

```python
def sv_eff(x, m, lambda_h):
    smin = 4.0 * pow(m, 2)
    smax = 20.0 * pow(m, 2)
    integral, err = scipy.integrate.quad(
        integrand_sveff_t, 1.0/smax, 1.0/smin, args=(x, m, lambda_h), epsabs=0, epsrel=1.0e-3)
    return integral
```

Finally, you will need to interpolate (and extrapolate) the width data given in the table. Again, our friend scipy comes to the rescue; we can use `scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline` [docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline.html)
Be very careful about the units (GeV vs MeV). The code may look something like this:

```python
Gamma_h = scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline(
    Q_data_GeV, Gamma_data_GeV, extrapolate=True)
```

Gamma_h will now be a _function_ (of Q), that can be sent around and used in the rest of your code.

Note: **exptrapolating** using interpolation functions is often a **VERY** bad idea - always check if this is reasonable for your problem
